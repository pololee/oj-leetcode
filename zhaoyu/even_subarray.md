A subarray is a contiguous portion of an array. Given an array of
integers, you must determine the number of distinct subarrays that can
be formed having at most a given number of odd elements. Two subarrays
are distinct if they differ at least one position in their contents.

For example, if numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] and the maximum number of odd
element allowed, k = 1, the following is a list of the 8 distinct valid
subarrays.

[[1], [2], [3], [4], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [2, 3, 4]
