For a multi-branch tree, if there is a node R with R as the root, and the largest sub-tree of all its sub-trees has the least number of nodes, the node R is said to be the center of gravity of the tree.
Now give you a multi-branch tree with n nodes. Find the center of gravity of this tree. If there are multiple centers of gravity, return the one with the lowest number.
x[i], y[i] represents the two points of the i-th edge.

2 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= x[i], y[i] <= n
Have you met this question in a real interview?  
Example
Given x = [1], y = [2], return 1.

Explanation:
Both 1 and 2 can be center of gravity, but the number of 1 is the smallest.
Given x = [1,2,2], y = [2,3,4], return 2.

Explanation:
2 is the center of gravity.
