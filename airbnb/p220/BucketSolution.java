/**
 * Let us consider an example where each element is a person's birthday.
 * Your birthday, say some day in March, is the new element xx.
 * Suppose that each month has 3030 days and you want to know
 * if anyone has a birthday within t = 30t=30 days of yours.
 * Immediately, we can rule out all other months except February, March, April.
 *
 * The reason we know this is because each birthday
 * belongs to a bucket we called month! And the range covered by the buckets
 * are the same as distance tt which simplifies things a lot.
 * Any two elements that are not in the same or adjacent buckets
 * must have a distance greater than t
 * .
 * We apply the above bucketing principle and design buckets covering
 * the ranges of ..., [0,t], [t+1, 2t+1], ......,[0,t],[t+1,2t+1],....
 * We keep the window using this buckets. Then, each time,
 * all we need to check is the bucket that xx belongs to and its two adjacent buckets.
 *
 * Thus, we have a constant time algorithm for searching almost duplicate in the window.
 * One thing worth mentioning is the difference from bucket sort â€“
 * Each of our buckets contains at most one element at any time,
 * because two elements in a bucket means "almost duplicate"
 * and we can return early from the function.
 * Therefore, a HashMap with an element associated with
 * a bucket label is enough for our purpose.
